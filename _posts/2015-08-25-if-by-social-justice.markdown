My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about Social Justice. All right, here is how I feel about Social Justice:

If when you say [Social Justice](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9696162){:target="_blank"} you mean the [devil's brew](http://archive.is/XuRLu){:target="_blank"}, the [poison scourge](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/eid){:target="_blank"}, the [bloody monster](https://archive.is/BtDaA){:target="_blank"}{% cite Steve [responds](https://gist.github.com/steveklabnik/7cd3267a631c4847c34d){:target="_blank"}. %}, that [defiles innocence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/){:target="_blank"}, [dethrones reason](http://www.joyent.com/blog/the-power-of-a-pronoun){:target="_blank"}, [destroys the home](http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13383243/donald-sterling-files-divorce-estranged-wife-shelly-sterling){:target="_blank"}, creates [misery](http://valleywag.gawker.com/and-now-a-funny-holiday-joke-from-iacs-pr-boss-1487284969){:target="_blank"}{% cite From AIDS to True Stories - Sam [endorses](http://gawker.com/justine-sacco-is-good-at-her-job-and-how-i-came-to-pea-1653022326){:target="_blank"} Justine one year later for crisis managment. %} and [poverty](https://twitter.com/adriarichards/status/313417655879102464){:target="_blank"}{% cite Adria later [annals](http://butyoureagirl.com/2013/03/18/adria-richards-on-dongle-jokes-and-pycon-2013/){:target="_blank"} her 'Lord of the Flies' like experience. %}, yea, [literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681){:target="_blank"}; if you mean the [evil](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/man-receives-sex-act-while-blacked-out-gets-accused-of-sexual-assault/article/2565978){:target="_blank"} ... that [topples the Christian man](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/black-lives-matter-protesters-shut-down-bernie-sanders-rally/){:target="_blank"}{% cite Bernie Sanders [is actually Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Personal_life){:target="_blank"}. %} and woman from the pinnacle of righteous (OK, I've got nothing), [gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3139644/Lecturer-revealed-Sir-Tim-Hunt-s-sexist-comments-says-no-regrets-costing-Nobel-Prize-winner-job.html){:target="_blank"}, and [despair](http://i.imgur.com/BbHeIHW.png){:target="_blank"}, and [shame](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web){:target="_blank"} and [helplessness](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23STOPCLYMER){:target="_blank"}{% cite An account of the path from reputable SJW to literally worse than Hitler is found in [SSC](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/14/living-by-the-sword/){:target="_blank"} (and also musings on whale cancer).%}, and [hopelessness](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2014/04/brendan_eich_quits_mozilla_let_s_purge_all_the_antigay_donors_to_prop_8.html){:target="_blank"}, then certainly [I am against it](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/){:target="_blank"}.

But, if when you say [Social Justice](https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/){:target="_blank"} you mean the oil of conversation, the [philosophic wine](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/){:target="_blank"}, the [ale that is consumed when good fellows get together](https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/){:target="_blank"}, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean [Christmas cheer](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits){:target="_blank"}; if you mean the stimulating drink that [puts the spring in the old gentleman's step on a frosty, crispy morning](https://twitter.com/hashtag/distractinglysexy){:target="_blank"}{% cite [In reaction to Tim Hunt](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33099289){:target="_blank"} %}; if you mean the drink which enables a man to [magnify his joy](https://blog.ycombinator.com/diversity-and-startups){:target="_blank"}, and his [happiness](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web){:target="_blank"}{% cite Reddit retaliates in response to the [Doxing](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doxing){:target="_blank"} by [banning all Gawker links](http://gawker.com/5951987/reddits-biggest-troll-fired-from-his-real-world-job-reddit-continues-to-censor-gawker-articles){:target="_blank"}. %}, and to forget, if only for a little while, [life's great tragedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting#Context_of_racism){:target="_blank"}, and [heartaches](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/virginia-killer-motivated-s-church-shooting-article-1.2338153){:target="_blank"}, and [sorrows](http://heidiroizen.tumblr.com/post/84530650750/its-different-for-girls){:target="_blank"}; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries [untold millions of dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our [dumb](http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/26/donald-sterling-clippers-owner-black-people-racist-audio-magic-johnson/){:target="_blank"}, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways and hospitals and schools, then certainly [I am for it](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

It is exhaustively hard to find people with opposing beliefs being nice to each other on the Internet.
